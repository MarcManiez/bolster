# BOLSTER

Bolster is a new way to budget your money. 

Saving is hard. It requires a clear plan, and even worse, conviction. What if you could jumpstart that conviction? 

Bolster's approach to budgets is gamifying them. We help you define a budget based on historical data and make saving for that next vacation or improving your overall saving into a game. 

You may wonder what gamification is. It is the process of applying game mechanics to a goal to motivate a person to acheive that goal. It gives context to your goal and makes progress - or the lack of progress - easier to quantify and track. There can be more fine-tuned reinforcement of good or bad behavior. In other words, a lazy person's best friend. 

With Bolster, you simply plug in your data, we analyze it and present it to you in an easy way to understand (think charts, lots of charts). This allows you to see patterns in your spending. Your habits become clearer. 

After that, we guide you through ways to make reducing bad habits and reach saving goals into a well designed game. You can track your progress through an overall score. You can think of it as a credit score. We call it a SNAZZY NAME score.

Once you start the game, you can check in daily, weekly or monthly and watch your score go up.
